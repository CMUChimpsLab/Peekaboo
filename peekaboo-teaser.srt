Imagine a smart TV developer claims to collect
summarized data to their server once a week.

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:14,949
How can outsiders validate this claim, while
the TV, the communication, and the server

3
00:00:14,949 --> 00:00:16,990
are all black-boxes?

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,699
In this paper, we ask how to help developers
avoid collecting unnecessary data and make

5
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,339
it transparent.

6
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:31,210
We introduce peekaboo, a new architecture
that leverages an in-home hub to pre-process

7
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,210
outgoing data.

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,770
In Peekaboo, developers create a data collection
manifest using a fixed set of chainable operators.

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:46,500
The hub then assembles and executes a pre-processing
pipeline using operators pre-loaded on the

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
hub.

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:53,210
In doing so, developers collect only necessary
data; outsiders can verify data collection

12
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,110
behaviors; and the hub can offer built-in
privacy features.
